== C0GUELF ~She left the Hand long ago, leaving only a farewell letter in her place, and I never saw her again. In the time I have spent ruminating on the past, I believe it was my own strictness and expectations that drove a rift between us.

== C0GUELF ~Then what brought you to the North, to risk your life facing demons and wretched shadows?~
== C0GULDJ ~My... friend was a great man. He lived his life to be a hero whose name would bring his daughter pride. Before his death, his regret was that he had ultimately failed to accomplish that one goal.~
== C0GULDJ ~Often my heart still wavers in doubt, for I know my place may be at the child's side... but, as a foolish old man bound by sentimentality... I merely hoped to fulfill my late friend's last, selfish wish.~

== C0GULDJ ~Butâ€”~
== C0GUELF ~This is my decision, one I doubt my ancestors would deny, had they the sense to. There is no better way for this blade to find purpose again than to fight evil. Consider this *my* selfish request.~
